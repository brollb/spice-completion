This repo contains code for exploring auto completion of spice netlists.

## Quick Start
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python train.py path/to/netlist.net
```

Since it is still far from complete, it is probably best to run in the interpreter so you can explore the trained model, etc:
```bash
python -i train.py path/to/netlist.net
```
